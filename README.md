The language model, **ConversationalGPT-2**, was built from scratch using [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) and follows a transformer architecture similar to modern language models.

Initially, the model was trained on the [fineweb dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/HuggingFaceFW/fineweb-edu) to predict the most likely continuation of text. It was then fine-tuned on the [DailyDialog dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/li2017dailydialog/daily_dialog) to enhance its ability to engage in natural, coherent conversations.

With over 100 million parameters, training was conducted on the [Kaggle platform](https://www.kaggle.com/):

The trained model is also available on Kaggle and can be found here:

## Running the Model  
To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Download the repository to your local machine.
2. Run the Python script `chat_interface.py`.
   - If the necessary models are not already present, they will automatically be downloaded.

# Preview
This section provides a demonstration of how the model responds in conversations. You can view a sample dialogue in action via the GIF below:
**To be added...**

The dialogues presented here illustrate different aspects of the model's conversational abilities. Each interaction was generated by the model, and you can reproduce them by downloading the project and asking similar questions. <br>
